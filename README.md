# *** In-Work *** Jets - Java, Object-Oriented Program

## Description
A fleet of jets with different capabilities. The application will be a menu to use jets and access information about them.

## Structure
All jets have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them. Speed is in MPH and mach. Range will be in Kilometers. Price is in USD.

Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).

## How to Run
On program startup, AirField is populated with 5 Jets of different types.
These jets must be read from a text file, where each line in the file contains data for a single Jet object.

2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
